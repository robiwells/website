If my daddy were a developer, \
Our house would be smartly wired. \
The toaster’d tweet, the fridge compete, \
And the Roomba never tired.

If my daddy were a developer,\
He’d name our pets in code.\
Our goldfish called “NullPointer”,\
Our cat named “Overflow”.

If my daddy were a developer,\
Bedtime would be a loop.\
“Go to bed;” he’d sternly said,\
Until I finally coop.

If my daddy were a developer,\
Weekends would be a quest.\
We’d game all day in a virtual way,\
But mom might protest.

If my daddy were a developer,\
Our meals would be gourmet.\
With 3D prints of foodie hints,\
In flavors all array.

If my daddy were a developer,\
Our chores would be a game.\
With points to score for mopping floors,\
Housework would bring fame.

If my daddy were a developer,\
He’d code a friendly bot.\
To help with math and run my bath,\
A helper on the spot.

If my daddy were a developer,\
Our lights would change with mood.\
In colors bright, they’d shine at night,\
Adjusting to our groove.

If my daddy were a developer,\
He’d teach me how to code.\
In Python streams, we’d build our dreams,\
And watch our programs load.

If my daddy were a developer,\
He’d build a rocket ship.\
We’d tour the stars, bypassing Mars,\
On an interstellar trip.
