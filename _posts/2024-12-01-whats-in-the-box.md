## A call to conscious participation in the digital age. 

In worlds of play where wonders hide, \
We seek the thrills that live inside. \
A prize unseen ignites our quest, \
For mysteries we love the best.


Our minds light up when chance is near, \
Uncertain wins make joy appear. \
Dopamine hums, a siren’s call, \
To randomness, we surrender all. 


Rewards that come at random spins,\
Keep us hooked like magic pins.\
Not every act will bring a treat,\
But when it does, it feels so sweet.


In apps we tap and games we play, \
We chase the chance that luck might stay.\
A spin, a loot box, just one more,\
We’re drawn to see what lies in store.


It’s not just wins that keep us near,\
But the suspense we hold so dear.\
The wait, the hope, the looming thrill,\
Is part of why we chase up hill.


Each time we win, a habit grows,\
A path our mind now freely knows. \
We loop around to feel that high, \
Returning where rewards may lie. 


We scroll and swipe to see what’s new,\
Perhaps a like or comment cue.\
The feed refreshes, changes bring,\
An endless search for the next best thing.


But careful now, the line is thin,\
Between a game and trapped within.\
When control slips and time is lost,\
We must reflect upon the cost.


Designers craft the paths we take, \
Deciding how the patterns make. \
With ethics placed at core design, \
We can build experiences that shine. 


Variable rewards can entice, \
A blend of thrill and loaded dice. \
Yet, knowing how and why we play, \
Empowers us to find our way.

As we move forward, may we all — designers, parents, and users alike — commit to fostering environments where technology serves as a tool for growth, connection, and joy, enhancing our lives while respecting our innate need for balance and autonomy.
