In realms where structured tables reign, \
Each link precise, each join maintained,\
Data flows in ordered streams,\
One young architect’s dreams.

But as the queries grow and strain,\
Performance starts to feel the pain,\
Complex paths that users tread,\
Slow the flow where once it sped.

When reads outpace the writes you make,\
And speed’s the prize that you must take,\
Caching truths in duplicated form,\
To weather traffic’s raging storm.

For dashboards bright and reports that shine,\
Where swift access must align,\
Denormalize to light the way,\
Ensuring insights seize the day.

Yet weigh the costs of data’s spread,\
Risk inconsistencies ahead,\
Implement checks to maintain the thread,\
Ensuring trust where data’s led.

Plan updates with a careful scheme,\
Document each streamlined dream,\
Balance speed with data’s grace,\
Achieve efficiency in its place.
