Prickly Journeys is a learn & earn app that helps spark a life-long love of learning in kids. Kids learn subjects – from levelling up on coding, to getting down with the Romans – while pocketing virtual currency for some of their favourite games (like Robux and V-Bucks). Rewards provide a continuous incentive that sets kids up on a virtuous learning circle.
