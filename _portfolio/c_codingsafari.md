What your child will learn from Hopster Coding Safari:


- The fundamentals of computational thinking

- Foundations of coding

- Problem solving

- Planning


This game will engage young children in computational thinking - the fundamental techniques needed to understand coding - without them realising they are learning. It will also ignite their passion for puzzles and problem-solving - all while playing a fun game with animals.


It could be the Tiger that needs to get back to her den, the Penguin trying to return to its Antarctic Ice Hole, the hungry Monkey desperate to get to the banana tree, or one of the other animals in this app - here, play is at the heart of learning to code.


The tasks in Hopster Coding Safari become increasingly complex to resolve, and completing them gently guides your child through the four fundamental techniques of computational thinking:


- Decomposition

- Pattern recognition

- Abstraction

- Algorithms


These are the basic techniques children need in order to learn how to code. So our game doesn't teach any specific programming languages but gives young children these foundations from which they will build on and learn to code.
