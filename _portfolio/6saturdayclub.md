Understanding emotions can be a difficult concept for young kids to fully grasp, whether it’s their own feelings or the emotional state of others.


‘Hopster Saturday Club: Empathy’ is a fantastic game designed to develop kid’s fundamental social and emotional literacy skills. As they play the mini-games they will begin to recognize and understand different emotions and learn lots of new ‘feelings words’ to describe how they and the characters are feeling.


Developed with the support of EmpathyLab, a UK not-for-profit organization that inspires children to understand empathy and put it into action, the game builds on primary school activities designed to build real-life empathy skills.
